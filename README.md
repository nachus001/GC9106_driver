# GC9106_driver
GC9106 driver for the TFT_eSpi TFT library by Bodmer

This driver was originally converted by Boyeen and discussed here https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/discussions/1310
It manages some issues regarding the cheap chinese displays ST7735S based.

Some of them seems to adjust more to the Galaxycore's GC9106 TFT driver IC
(datasheet available here https://www.phoenixdisplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GC9106_DS_V1.0_20170308.pdf)

So, here is my (minimal) correction to the driver
